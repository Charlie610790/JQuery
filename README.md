Jquery - Game Of Thrones Store


This was my first attempt using JQuery.  This is a website pulling items from an array generated of ETSY items using forEach, map, and other JQuery methods to display these images on the site.  The sidebar links to other collection arrays pulled from ETSY for subcategories of items.
